# LIGHT-SENSOR
A light sensor is a device that detects the intensity of light in its environment. It converts light energy into an electrical signal that can be measured or used to trigger certain actions. Common types of light sensors include photodiodes, phototransistors, and light-dependent resistors (LDRs).
